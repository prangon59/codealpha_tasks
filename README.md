# CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship - Task Tracker

Welcome to the CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship Task Tracker! This repository is dedicated to keeping a record of all the tasks assigned to me during my internship at CodeAlpha from June 10, 2024, to September 10, 2024. I will update this repository regularly as I complete each task.

## About the Internship

The CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship is a fantastic opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the field of cyber security. The internship focuses on learning new skills and gaining a deeper understanding of concepts through practical application.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

.
├── Task-1/
│ ├── description.md
│ ├── implementation.md
│ └── results/

│ └── results/

├── Task-3/
│ ├── description.md
│ ├── implementation.md
│ └── results/

.
.


- Each `Task-X` directory will contain:
